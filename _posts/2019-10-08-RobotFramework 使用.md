After the robot framework is intalled. Here's simple demo to give it a try.
```
*** Settings ***
Documentation  present some info of this test suite
Library  SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${Browser}  chrome

*** Test Cases ***
Guest must sign in to check
    [Documentation]  test this
    Open Browser  http://www.amazon.com  ${Browser}
    Close Browser
```
You can install the Library using    
    pip3 install robotframework-seleniumLibrary
Another thing is that to use selienium, you also need to download a chromedriver and put it to a directory under PATH. So that it can autiomatically find the driver and start the test.      
The script uses two spaces as separator.
